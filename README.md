# DND Encounter Tracker

I felt something was missing in the DnD encounter trackers I was using:

- Easily adding characters while the encounter was happening
- Using a multiplier to increase HP of an added character

So I built my own. Runs here: [https://dnd-encounter-tracker.vercel.app/](https://dnd-encounter-tracker.vercel.app/).
